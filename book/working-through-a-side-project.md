Summary: Programming projects ideas for learning Python.

Working Through A Sideproject
=============================

You will inevitably run into problems as you work through the projects. 
This section is dedicated to getting you started with your best foot forward.
If you get stuck, come back and take a look at the strategies. If you're still stuck,
try posting on the Python Practice Projects Forums (http://discourse.pythonpracticeprojects.com/).
You can also email me at louie [at] pythonpracticeprojects.com. Do try your best to solve it
yourself first though. 

Before Starting - Get the Lay Of The Land
-----------------------------------------

    If I had one hour to save the world, I would spend 55 minutes 
    defining the problem and only five minutes finding the solution. 
    â€“Albert Einstein

Before you start any project, spend some time understanding the problem domain. Each project helps you along with 
the "Motivation" section at the beginning. Read it. Then go read the Wikipedia article. Google the term and 
look at a few of the top links.

Make sure you can summarize the key concepts with a sentence each. For example, if you don't know what HTTP is,
 then just search wikipedia. If you could tell me that HTTP is the agreed upon language that computers use to
 send Hyper Text documents between each other, then that is enough to proceed.

Gain Intuition On The Problem
------------------------------

One of the best ways to approach a problem is to first download one of the recommended
reference implementations and just play around with the toy examples presented in the documentation.
Get it up and running. Go through the sample cases. Try a few different options
to see what they do. Just explore a bit. Try to think of some use cases for it.
In this step, you're building valuable intuition that will pay off down the road.

Once you have a good idea of what the tool does and what it should be used for,
re-read the problem statement. It should make a lot more sense now. 
If you're are probably still confused as to where to start. That's OK. A good problem
is like a maze. You can't see the end from the beginning and the only way to proceed
is to enter the maze and start walking.

Starting a Project
------------------

It's easy to get analysis paralysis at the beginning. Either from your brain
going completely blank to a hundred possible solutions. It doesn't matter where
on this spectrum you fall. Everyone is going to start the problem in the same way.

Just open up a text editor, create a new file and type the following.

    def execute():
        print "hello"
 
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        execute()
 
Now ask yourself, what is the tiniest piece of functionality I can build?
Put that bit of logic in execute. Then from there just slowly edge your way to the solution.

Don't Be Afraid to Rewrite
--------------------------

False starts are a fact of life. You can start going down an avenue,
only to hit a dead end. That's OK. 

    I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.
    -Thomas A. Edison
 
Sometimes you have to restructure a method. Sometimes you have to 
bundle a bunch of methods into a class. Sometimes you'll need 
to toss out huge swaths of functionality and rewrite it because
you can't see how to get from your partial solution to the full
solution. 

This isn't failing. This is learning. You're building the invaluable
intuition needed to more successfully plan your attack next time.

Each dead end you hit shines some light on your problem landscape.
It's progress! If you're feeling frustrated, go do something else for 
a while. Then come back with a fresh perspective.


On Getting Unstuck
------------------

If you're stuck, go take a break. Then try again tomorrow.
If you're still stuck, then take a look at how some of the
reference solutions got around that exact problem. The
problems presented each have numerous high quality implementations 
linked at the bottom to help in this exact situation.

Don't be afraid to dig into the reference code. You don't have to understand the whole thing.
You just need to read enough to get around your road block.

Finally, you can always reach out for help either on the [forums](http://discourse.pythonpracticeprojects.com)
or by sending me an email. I'll try my best to help you along.


Celebrate
---------

Once you finish, celebrate. Each problem that you finish
is another step in the path towards mastery. Take a look back
and think about all the things you didn't know before!

Best of luck on your programming journey. I'm rooting for you.
