Summary: Coaching offer for working through projects

Offer For Coaching
==================

Do you want a bit of help to supercharge your programming journey? Then read on.

This book is written to be a self-contained guide to leveling up your programming chops. However, if you feel like a bit of external
motivation would help you then I have a special offer for you as an owner of Python Practice Projects ebook.

I know it can be exhausting to wrestle with errors, Google technical terms, and read up on all the necessary background to tackle
a project. 

Once you're finished a project, it's difficult to know how well you've done, figure out how to improve your solution and package it in a way that 
employers will find compelling.

I know learning to program is difficult. I remember taking weeks to master some of the most fundamental concepts in programming. 

This is why I'm taking on a limited (think less than 10) students into a paid private coaching program. You will get regular milestones, skype check-ins, extensive code reviews and  email contact
with me to help bust through any issues that come up.

Like all accellerated learning, it's going to be a bit uncomfortable. You will be pushed beyond your comfort zone, but in the end you'll be amazed at how much ground you've covered. 

Just email me at louie@pythonpracticeprojects.com with the subject "PRIVATE COACHING REQUEST!"

Don't worry about commitment. I'm flexible with either per iteration, per project or the whole shebang; whatever works best for you.
