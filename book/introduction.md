Summary: Programming projects ideas for learning Python.

Before Starting The Journey
===========================

Are you an aspiring Python software developer? Have you completed countless tutorials
and don't know where to go next? Do you feel stuck on a plateau that you can't seem to break past?

Fear Not! In your virtual hands is a path through this leg of the programming wilderness. 
Welcome to Python Practice Projects. My name is Louie and I will be your guide.

Learning to program is a long and winding journey. Each phase has unique challenges
that you must face and conquer before you can comfortably move on. I hope this book
finds you right after you have grasped the fundamentals of programming.

The following material does not deal with the elementry constructs of programming.
I will assume that you are already familiar with variables, values, functions, classes, inheritance,
simple data structures, looping, flow control, and at least a vague understanding of abstraction
and testing.


Why Practice Projects?
----------------------

While learning Python, I found a wealth of material dedicated to teaching the syntax
and semantics of the language. Many minds far greater than mine have written _very_
good tutorials on all aspects of the language.

I still had a problem though. Even after careful readings, I found that the concepts didn't
_really_ stick. It wasn't until I had seen the concepts in real programs _and_ attempted to incorporate
them into my own programs, that I finally understood the benefits and also limitations of each
feature and library.

That is why Python Practice Projects contains two essential parts. The first is the project
descriptions themselves. These problems were not chosen randomly. Each one was designed to be
challenging, yet compactly solvable. The basic solution shouldn't be more than a few hundred
lines of code. The second part is the links to production quality solutions. After the flowering
of the Open Source movement, we can now read the minds of world class programmers. Solving a problem,
without seeing how it can be done more elegantly is leaving the majority of the learning on the table.

The projects are specifically presented without their solutions to force your thinking. It will be a 
bit uncomfortable. Just remember that learning to walk was also pretty uncomfortable. I bet you're
glad you didn't give up on that though.

There _are_ a few sample solutions included. These are for after you've made a real attempt at solving
the problems. If you read them before, I'm not refunding your lost learning opportunities =]


Who Am I?
---------

I'm a professional software engineer and I use Python...a lot. At work I use Python
to write web services that power games for hundreds of thousands of users. At home I use
it to scrape The Internet, manage my inbox and draw pretty graphs.

I love Python, and I want to help you love it too! And what's not to love? It's a beautiful
language with a friendly community. After 5+ years of learning and using the language,
I want to pass on some hard won experiences. 

*This book is me nudging you along your own path to programming mastery*


Expectations
------------

Let's be honest here. I expect a lot from you. You're a mature learner now and not everything
will be spoon fed. This book is best read in front of a computer. If you come across something you
 don't understand, look it up. Don't just skim by, because you'll only get more confused later on.
 You don't have to become an expert, just know enough to summarize it in a quick sentence.

This isn't a passive book. Reading it won't do you any good. In most books,
you tend to get about 10% of the benefits from just reading it. In this book, it's more like 1%. However,
if you diligently work through all the problems, you'll get much closer to 100%.

OK, that's all for the preamble. Welcome to Python Practice Projects! Next, I'm going to quickly
go over how to approach the projects. Then it's onto the projects themselves.
