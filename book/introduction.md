Introduction
============

Hello and welcome to Python Practice Projects. My name is Louie. It's a pleasure to meet you.

Thank you for purchasing the Python Practice Projects! I hope that you'll get
as much from working through this book as I got from writing it. A word of caution,
this isn't a passive book. Reading it won't do you any good. In most books,
you tend to get 10% of the benefits from just reading it. In this book, it's more like 1%. However,
if you diligently work through all the problems, you'll get much closer to 100%.


Who Am I?
---------

I'm a professional software engineer that uses a lot of Python. At work I use Python
to write web services that power games for hundreds of thousands of users. At home I use
it to scrape The Internet, manage my inbox and draw pretty graphs.

I love Python, and I want to help you love it too! And what's not to love? It's a beautiful
language with a friendly community. After 5+ years of learning and using the language,
I wanted to pass on some hard won experiences. 

*This book is me nudging you along your own path to programming mastery*

Why Practice Projects?
----------------------

While learning Python, I found a wealth of material dedicated to teaching the syntax
and semantics of the language. Many minds far greater than mine have written _very_
good tutorials on all aspects of the language.


I still had a problem though. Even after careful readings, I found that the concepts didn't
_really_ stick. It wasn't until I had seen the concepts in real programs _and_ attempted to incorporate
them into my own programs , did I finally understand the benefits and also limitations of each
feature and library.

That is why Python Practice Projects contains two essential parts. The first are the project
descriptions themselves. These problems were not chosen randomly. Each one was designed to be
challenging, yet compactly solvable. The basic solution shouldn't be more than a few hundred
lines of code. The second part are the links to production quality solutions. After the flowering
of the Open Source movement, we can now read the minds of the world class programmers. Solving a problem,
without seeing how it can be more elegantly solved, is leaving the majority of the learning opportunity 
on the table.

The projects are specifically presented without their solutions to force your thinking. It will be a 
bit uncomfortable. Just remember that learning to walk was also pretty uncomfortable. I bet you're
glad you didn't give up on that though.

There _are_ a few sample solutions included. These are for after you've made a real attempt at solving
the problems. If you read them before, I'm not refunding your lost learning opportunities =]

Expectations
------------

Let's be honest here. I expect a lot of from you. You're a mature learner now and not everything
will be spoon fed. This book is best read in front of a computer. If you come across something you
 don't understand, look it up. Don't just skim by, because you'll only get more confused later on.
 You don't have to become an expert when looking something up, just know enough to summarize it in 
a quick sentence.

OK, that's all for the preamble. Welcome to Python Practice Projects! Next, I'm going to quickly
go over how to approach the projects. Then it's onto the projects themselves.
