Summary: Programming projects ideas for learning Python.

Hello and welcome to Python Practice Projects. 

Thank you for purchasing the premium copy of my book. I hope that you'll get
as much from working through this book as I got from writing it. A word of caution though,
this isn't a passive book. Reading it won't do you any good. In most books,
you tend to get 10% of everything you read. In this book, it's more like 1%. However,
the flip side is, if you diligently work through all the problems, you'll get much closer
to 100%.

Let's be honest here. I expect a lot of from you. This book is best read in front of a 
computer. If you come across something you don't understand, look it up. Don't just
skim by, because you'll only get more confused later on. You don't have to become an expert
when looking something up, just know enough to summarize it in a quick sentence.

Get the Lay Of The Land
---------------

For example, if you don't know what HTTP is, then just search wikipedia. If you could
tell me that HTTP is the agreed upon language that computers use to send Hyper Text
documents between each other, then that is enough to proceed.

The problems presented in this book are specifically selected for maximum learning 
potential. Each one has numerous extremely high quality implementations available on the
web. I have selected what I believed to be the best examples to look at.

Don't be afraid to dig into the code. You don't have to understand the whole thing.

Gain Intuition
--------------

One of the best ways to approach a problem is to first download one of the recommended
libraries and just play around with the toy examples presented in the documentation.
Get it up and running. Go through the sample cases. Try a few different options
to see what they do. Just explore a bit. Try to think of some use cases for it.
You're building valuable intuition that will pay off down the road.

Once you have a good idea of what the tool does and what it should be used for,
re-read the problem statement. It should make a lot more sense now and you should
have a good idea of how you want your program to act. You are probably still
confused as to where to start. That's OK.

Starting a Project
------------------

Just open up a text editor and type the following.

    def execute():
        print "hello"

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        execute()

Now ask yourself, what's the tiniest piece of functionality I can build starting from nothing?
Put that in execute. Then from there just slowly edge your way to the solution.

Don't Be Afraid to Rewrite
--------------------------

Sometimes you have to restructure a method. Sometimes you have to 
bundle a bunch of methods into a class. Other times you'll need 
to toss out huge swaths of functionality and rewrite it because
you can't see how to get from your partial solution to the full
solution. 

This isn't failing. This is learning. You're building the invaluable
intuition needed to more successfully plan your attack next time.


On Getting Unstuck
----------------

If you're stuck, go take a break. Then try again tomorrow.
If you're still stuck, then take a look at how some of the
reference solutions got around that exact problem. If you're
STILL stuck, then take to the internets or as in the
Python Practice Projects dicussion forums. I'll be there to help you ;)


Celebrate
---------

Once you finish, celebrate. Each problem that you finish
is another step in the path towards mastery. Take a look back
and think about all the things you didn't know!

Best of luck on your programming journey. I'm rooting for you.
