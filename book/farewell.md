What Did You Think?
====================

This book is my best attempt at giving you a great programming education. I would love to hear your thoughts on the book. All feedback is _greatly_ appreciated.

Do you feel like you're better at programming? What could I have done to improve your educational experience? What else would you like to see in the future?

I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Just drop me an email - louie@pythonpracticeprojects.com

Farewell
========

You've made it! Congratulations on making it to the end. None of these projects are easy. I hope working through them has given you a little bit more insight into the art of programming.
There will always be struggles ahead, but don't let that turn you from the field.

As a field, programming is still incredibly young. The total history of programming on digital computers spans not even a century. A blink of an eye in historical terms. Yet,
computers are among the most disruptive technologies of human history. Programming has tranformed our lives because it allows us to scale human thought. The ability to record
an intelligent behaviour, and then replay it at will, greatly reduced the man hours required to keep civilization running.

Now you can do it too. If you've completed all of these practice exercises, you too hold the power to scale thoughts. The problem now is to figure out which thoughts are worth
recording in a useful manner. Remember, that programming is only a tool and it is what you do with it that matters. There is still so much of life that could be simplified
with a little bit of intelligent computation. 

All the software in the world is built bit by bit (pun intentional). If you can imagine it, you can build it. The only limiting factor now is the scope of your imagination. Before you
move on to not-so-practice projects, I just want to leave you with two parting thoughts.

Don't get caught up in the latest fad technologies or chasing what you think the job market will want next. You can only ever play catch up. Instead, learn to make computers do something
useful and you will never run out of opportunities. 

Remember to have fun. Programming is a fundamentally creative endeavour. When you work too hard without enough fun, you start hating what you're doing. Don't let this happen. It may seem like you should just
put your head down and grind through this project. That's OK once in a while but don't make it a habit. Programming should be fun, and if it's not, then write a tool to automate the boring parts.
Keeping things fun will go a long way towards making sure that you keep learning, growing, and advancing our collective understanding of this new human endeavour.

Until next time, happy programming.
