Summary: Barbell strategy for learning

>Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.
― Isaac Asimov

Every human is born with a super power: the ability to learn. Everything you
know is learned. Like all important endeavours, a lifetime of learning merits
some planning. We will classify the types of learning and then explore the
effective use of your super power.

In very broad strokes, learning can be split into two categories: Just-In-Time
and Just-In-Case. School is the perfect example of Just-In-Case learning. You
are asked to do algebra, read Chaucer and argue against a geocentric universe.
Don’t you dare ask why. There is no reason. Or the reason is in some distant
future that probably isn’t going to happen anyway.On the other hand, work is an
example of Just-In-Time learning. On your first day, you have no clue how to do
the job. So you watch, and you copy and you finish the task. Why are you
learning? To get the job done because your livelihood depends on it. The
rewards are very concrete.

At the heart of this split is the question of value. When will this learning
pay off? Just-In-Time learning creates immediate value. You’re learning to surf
because you have a vacation booked in two weeks. You’re reading a book because
you have a book club meeting to attend. We will consider value as simply
something that you want to have. The thing can be enjoyment, fun, fame, money,
or appearing attractive. Whatever floats your boat. Just-In-Case learning is a
risky delayed value proposition. You’re not certain it’s going to pay off. Will
studying algebra make you attractive to the opposite sex? Only time will tell.

Now if you’re reading to figure out which is the One True Way, I’m going to
disappoint you. Neither Just -In-Time nor Just-In-Case is better. Schools
preach only Just-In-Case methodology. Work argues exclusively for Just-In-Time
chops. Both are lying to you.

The optimal strategy comes from sound investment principles: diversify. Like
investing, allocating your capital across different asset classes with
different risk/reward profiles tends to maximize return while minimizing risk.

Just-In-Time learning is like buying bonds. Safe investments that gives a very
predictable reward. You know what you need to know. You learn it. You get the
pay off. It’s all money in the bank.

Just-In-Case learning is more risky, like stocks. You learn something and
expect a future reward. The future comes and you guessed wrong. D’oh. However,
once in a while you run across a problem that is solvable by something you
learned Just-in-Case. You bust out your mental tools and annihilate the
offending issue. Everyone looks at you in bewilderment and think that you must
be a goddamn genius. Boom. Just-In-Case learning. The beauty of Just-In-Case is
most stunning when applied to notoriously difficult subjects like mathematics,
programming or writing. Achieving mastery in each field requires an inordinate
amount of time. When you run into a thorny programming problem, you can’t run
off for 10 years to self educate.[[Teach Yourself Programming in 10
Years]](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)

It’s up to you to determine the right mix of risky versus safe investments I
suggest using Just-In-Time learning until you are generating enough value to
sustain your lifestyle. Then invest in Just-In-Case learning and swing for the
fences.

Happy Learning!
