Summary: Programming projects ideas for learning Python.


A craft cannot be learned by reading alone; practice is also necessary.
To learn best, we need a well-defined task at an appropriate
level of difficulty. Python Practice Projects is such a collection of problems,
each designed to straddle the line between toy example and production system.

I've tried to define the problems as clearly as possible along with links to reference solutions.
Go ahead and try tackling these problems yourself.

This is currently a work in progress and suggestions are warmly welcomed.
If you have other ideas, solutions, or just want to chat,
drop me a line on twitter or shoot me an email at [firstname][lastname] @ google's email service.
