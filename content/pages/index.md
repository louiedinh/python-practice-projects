Summary: Programming projects ideas for learning Python.

A craft cannot be learned by reading alone; practice is also necessary.
To learn best, you need a well-defined task at an appropriate
level of difficulty. Python Practice Projects is such a collection of problems,
each designed to straddle the line between toy example and production system.

All too often the answer to, "What is a good project for learning programming?"
is "Whatever interests you." Not too helpful eh?

Here is a set of practice problems that you can really sink your teeth into. These are stretch 
problems. Don't expect them to be easy. The links below contain your project starter kit.
Each problem was selected for both learning value and availability of high quality reference
implementations. 

As each problem gets fleshed out, I'll move them from Practice Project Ideas into the Detailed Practice Projects section.
