Summary: Programming projects ideas for learning Python.


A craft cannot be learned from reading alone; practice is also necessary.
The most effective learning requires a well-defined task with an appropriate
level of difficulty difficulty. Python Practice Projects is a collection of
example problems, each designed to straddle the line between toy example and production system.
All problems will contain references so you can attack the problems yourself.

I plan to work through these problems myself. If you have any ideas for other projects,
interested in discussing the solutions, or just want to talk, find me on twitter
 or shoot me an email at [firstname][lastname] @ google's email service.
