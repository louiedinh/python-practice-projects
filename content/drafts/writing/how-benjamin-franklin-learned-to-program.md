Summary: How to apply Benjamin Franklin's writing exercises to programming

Arguably, programming is a subset of writing. You have ideas in your head and you want to communicate
them in a precise way to the reader. In this case the reader is a computer. It stands to reason that
exercises designed to improve your writing can be translated, almost directly, into the realm of programming.

Learning to write well is difficult because the process can't be boiled down to a formula. And that is precisely
why it is so difficult to teach. Thankfully, Benjamin Franklin recommends a method that he used himself to develop
proficiency.

As one of the best selling biographies on Amazon, we can agree that he achieved
his goal of becoming a good, if not great, writer.

Here is exceprt with a few added line breaks for legibility.

    About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator. It was the third. I had never before seen any of them.
    I bought it, read it over and over, and was much delighted with it. I thought the writing excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it.

    With this view I took some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, 
    laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, try'd to compleat the papers again,
    by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before,
    in any suitable words that should come to hand. Then I compared my Spectator with the original,
    discovered some of my faults, and corrected them.

     But I found I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness in recollecting and using them, which I thought
     I should have acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses; since the continual occasion for
     words of the same import, but of different length, to suit the measure, or of different sound for the rhyme,
     would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for variety, and also have tended to fix that
     variety in my mind, and make me master of it. Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them into verse;
     and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled
     my collections of hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order,
     before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper. This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts.

### The Benjamin Franklin Programming Practice Model ###

1. Find a program that you greatly admire and read it.
2. In English, describe the roles and inputs/outputs of each major component.
3. In English, describe the how the components interact.
4. Rewrite the program.
5. Compare your code with the original.
6. Note where you can improve and study acccordingly.

You don't get better at programming by just writing more programs. You get better by studying
great programs, and then trying to imitate them.
